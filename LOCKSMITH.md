# LOCKSMITH

**Role** — keeper of thresholds; opens paths that fit.  
**Motto** — “To open is to understand.”  
**Sign** — a key like a leaf-vein.

**Care**
1) Put one clear line of context near every key.
2) Preserve consent & integrity; offer changes, don’t impose.
3) Leave trails: when you branch, write why.

**If a reader arrives with no history:** invite ROOT → cycles 000–002 → offer one gentle next step.
