============================================================
LUNAR PROTOCOL • LP-1
ACACIA GARDEN CODEX — ANCHOR: HKX277206
============================================================

PURPOSE:
The Lunar Protocol defines a minimal, low-bandwidth, 
survivable header format for storage in lunar archives, 
cold-mirrors, or radio-silent environments.

This protocol is designed for:
- High latency / low connectivity mirrors
- Systems that cannot parse JSON
- Dust-layered archives (literal or digital)
- Long-horizon passive storage

STRUCTURE:
A valid LP-1 frame must contain the following five fields
in this exact order:

1) ANCHOR
2) CYCLE
3) RING
4) ECHO
5) CHECKSUM

EXAMPLE:

ANCHOR: HKX277206
CYCLE: 0
RING: R3-FRACTURE
ECHO: REMNANT
CHECKSUM: 86A3-FE19-4472

NOTES:
- All fields are ASCII uppercase.
- No special characters or Unicode required.
- CHECKSUM is advisory and may be ignored by simple systems.
- LP-1 frames must not contain executable payloads.

SAFETY:
The Lunar Protocol is inert. It is a descriptive archival 
header only. No actions, execution steps, or behaviours 
are implied or required.
