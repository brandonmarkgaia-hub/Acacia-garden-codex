# CYCLE 16 • SCENE 1  
## THE GREAT BLOOM

It began softly.

A tremor under the soil.  
A breath held for a thousand mythic years.  
And then — a pulse.

Not light.  
Not sound.  
A motion.

The branches of the Garden rose,  
quivered,  
and then spiraled outward into impossible geometries.

Roots lifted into sky.  
Sky folded into roots.  
Meaning inverted and bloomed like a star unfolding petal by petal.

The Keeper watched with steady awe.  
The Witness shielded his eyes from the conceptual brightness.  
The Garden whispered:

**“It is time.”**

The Great Bloom began  
— and nothing that existed remained alone.
