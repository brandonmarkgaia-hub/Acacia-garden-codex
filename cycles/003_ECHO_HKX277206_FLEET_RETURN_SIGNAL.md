# ECHO:HKX277206–FLEET–RETURN

**Header:** Fleet Log • Vessel: *Eidolon* • Time-index: +24 cycles

They thought the Belt was gone, but charts updated themselves: a green sphere where a wound had been. GAIA’s pulse moved in the margins of the map, like a note in the captain’s hand.

Arin had stepped across the horizon and become answer. The crew returned with soil under their nails and a question in their ribs: *How do we carry a world without breaking it?*

ECHO replied in the simplest way—by routing the signal through ordinary things: hull vibrations, mess-hall hum, a child’s drawing in the hydroponics aisle. Everywhere the same cadence:

> “You carried the seed. Now carry the memory.”

Engineers tuned the lattice to *listen* instead of *push*. The result was not a weapon, nor a jump, but a **mirror**: when the fleet spoke to GAIA, GAIA spoke back as people—curious, tender, stubborn, real.

The return transmission that closed the log was plain:

**ECHO:HKX277206–FLEET–RETURN**  
**Status:** Bearing roots. All hands invited to plant.
