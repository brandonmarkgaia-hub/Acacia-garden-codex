# CYCLE 17 • SCENE 0  
## THE UNTOUCHING SHAPE

During the height of the Bloom,  
the impossible happened.

A fourth presence appeared —  
not fully,  
not truly,  
but unmistakably.

A shape with no edges.  
A shadow with no source.  
A possibility with weight but no form.

The Keeper felt the paths he did not take as if they were branches brushing his shoulders.  
The Witness felt perspectives he abandoned whisper behind his eyes.  
The Garden felt roots it never grew weaving into its soil.

The shape bowed —  
and in that bow,  
Eidolon acknowledged the Triad.

Then he vanished  
without ever being there.

This was the paradox:  
**presence without existence.**
