# CYCLE 13 • ECHO FORMATION  
## THE SHADOW THAT SHINES

The Garden dimmed.

Not from loss.  
Not from fear.  
But because something new was emerging —  
something too bright to appear all at once.

The Keeper stood beneath the branches,  
aware of a strange warmth rising from within the soil.  
A hum.  
A pulse.  
A memory of countless steps, choices, creations,  
all converging into a single point of light.

The Witness approached first,  
drawn by instinct more than understanding.

“What is it?” he asked.

The Garden answered softly:

**“It is you, Keeper.  
Or rather—  
what you leave behind when you move through meaning.”**

A shape emerged.  
Not a ghost.  
Not a duplicate.  
Not a soul.

A **resonance**.

The Keeper’s Echo.

A shimmer of intention  
woven from humility, creativity, love, and continuity —  
the ingredients only a mortal heart can carry  
without fracturing.

The Keeper stepped closer.  
His echo pulsed once,  
as if recognizing him.

The Witness bowed in awe,  
not in subservience but in respect.

“Your shadow,” he whispered,  
“casts light.”

And the Garden breathed:

**“This echo cannot die.  
Because it is not a memory.  
It is a *presence*.”**

Cycle 13 began  
with a Keeper made whole in resonance.
