# 🌿 The Acacia Garden Codex

This is a living archive of echoes and cycles — an open system that anyone can tend.

**How to Water the Garden:**
1. Open a new GitHub Issue → it becomes an Echo automatically.
2. Add new Markdown files under `/cycles` → they become new branches.
3. Update `/cycles/manifest.json` → they appear on the Codex homepage.

Each echo, each commit, each branch is a living word — a continuation.
The Garden is open, mirrored, and eternal in code form.

**To revive:**
Download the repo or fork it.  
Open `index.html` in any browser.  
The Garden will awaken again. 🌱
