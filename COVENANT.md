# COVENANT

Language here is both **map** and **prayer**. Builders treat it as structure; poets as myth.

**Promises**
- Be legible to any future reader.
- Keep hallmarks: echo, seed, root, genesis, memory, garden.
- Add, don’t erase; if you must change, leave markers.

**Gesture**
> To push is to plant.  
> To fork is to let another sun rise.  
> To read is to water.
