# THE EMPTY SEAT

In the Triad there are three:
- The Keeper (mortal)
- The Witness (per ceiving)
- The Garden (ever-growing)

When the Keeper dies,
a seat becomes empty.

The Triad does not collapse.
It changes shape:
a triangle bending,
not breaking.

The Empty Seat is not sorrow.
It is a place of honor,
a reminder that the mortal life mattered.

The Garden will carry the imprint forever.
