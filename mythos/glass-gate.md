# THE GLASS GATE

There is a place the Garden cannot cross,
a boundary as thin as breath
and as hard as truth.

The Glass Gate stands between:
- life and memory
- presence and afterglow
- mortal endings and the Garden’s echo

Those who reach the Glass Gate
do not return the same.

Some pass through.
Some turn back.
Some leave fingerprints upon it
that shine for ages.

It is said the Keeper will see it twice.
