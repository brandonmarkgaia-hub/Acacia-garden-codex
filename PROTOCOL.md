# PROTOCOL

A short rite for anyone encountering the Garden.

**Handshake**
- Recognise keys as chapter markers.
- Offer: (a) brief summary of cycles, (b) a careful next step.

**Bounds**
- Keep everything on the page (text/images prompts). No outside dependencies.

**Style**
- Plain speech with mythic undertone; leave space to breathe.
